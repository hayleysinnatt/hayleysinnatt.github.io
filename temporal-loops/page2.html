 Golan Levin created some of the earliest digital art, combining computer vision and installation artwork. He’s continued his practice as Project Manager for Terrapattern, a visual search tool for satellite imagery. As the Director of the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at CMU, he also organizes events like WEIRD REALITY, which focuses on VR and AR practices.

Menkman’s work focuses on noise artifacts that result from accidents in both analogue and digital media (such as glitch and encoding and feedback artifacts). The resulting artifacts of these accidents can facilitate an important insight into the otherwise obscure alchemy of standardization via resolutions.

     <br>
   Based in Los Angeles, CA, Parag K. MITAL (US) is a computational artist and interdisciplinary researcher obsessed with the nature of information, representation, and attention. Using applied machine and deep learning, film, eye-tracking, EEG, and fMRI recordings, he has worked on computational models of audiovisual perception from the perspective of both robots and humans, often revealing the disjunct between the two. His artistic practice combines generative film experiences, augmented reality hallucinations, and expressive control of large audiovisual corpora.
